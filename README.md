# Hello And Welcome To My Gear List!

With this app you may create a visual representation of the music gear that you have.

Let's get started!

## Launching The App
To launch the app simply bring up the login page and create an account. Once you create an account you can go ahead and log into your page.
Here you will see your profile. At first your gear list will be blank. Let's change that!

## Adding Some Gear
To create your first post click on "Add Gear." A form will populate asking you what you would like to add. You may select amplifier, pedal, guitar, or speaker cabinet. Upon clicking one of them you will be asked what KIND of amp, pedal, or guitar you would like to add. Since there's really only ONE kind of speaker cabinet, an additonal window does not open. Once you have selected what you are looking to add, you will be asked to fill out some specifics. After the fields have been filled out you may save the entry to your gear list!

## Editing A Post
Let's say you have an acoustic guitar listed and you recently had it restrung with some different strings. You may edit the inital post by clicking on the "pencil" icon. Here you may change whatever you need to update. Once you are done you may save the changes. Or if you need not update the post at all, go ahead and click "cancel."

## Deleting A Post
Now let's say you have sold something you have listed in your gear list. You may delete your entry by clicking on the trashcan icon. You will be prompted to confirm its deletion. You may choose at this point to have the post listed or confirm the entry's deletion. If you do have it deleted it will no longer be listed in your gear list.

## Logging Out
Whenever you would like to log out you may click on the logout button in the upper right-hand corner. This will take you back to the login page where you may log in again when you would like!
